# Library of Solomon 

An elegent library app designed to ease exploration into the world of Spiritualism and the Occult. Users will be able to look through a wide selection of books with links to GoodRead where they can learn more about their selections and make purchases.


## The Process

This project was created using the following technologies:- HTML, JAVASCRIPT, CSS, NODE.js, Json, Next.Js, MongoDB. Thanks to Next.Js's ability to integrate well and call data from MongoDB, I was able to create a flat Database in Mongo using book information taken from GoodReads. Designing the app's current features (random book select, directory display, dynamic search) was then a matter of manipulating statically generated props on the client's side. The book cover images are stored clientside for now.

### Write-up from MongoDB 

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era. This example will show you how to connect to and use MongoDB as your backend for your Next.js app.
