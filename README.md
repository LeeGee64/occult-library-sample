# Library of Solomon 

## The Purpose

An elegent library app designed to ease exploration into the world of Spiritualism and the Occult. 

## The Process

This project was created using the following technologies:- HTML, JAVASCRIPT, CSS, NODE.js, Json, Next.Js, MongoDB. Thanks to Next.Js's ability to integrate well and call data from MongoDB, I was able to create a flat Database in Mongo using book information taken from GoodReads. Designing the app's current features (random book select, directory display, dynamic search) was then a matter of manipulating statically generated props on the client's side. The book cover images are stored clientside for now.
